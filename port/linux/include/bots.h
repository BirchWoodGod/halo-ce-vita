/* bots.h: computer players for offline multiplayer (port/linux/game/bots.c)

A bot is a player of the local (split screen) game whose controls come from
code instead of a controller: it is in the lobby, the scores and the game's
rules as any player is, spawns and respawns, and scores. Each bot is the one
player of a machine of its own at the top of the machine indices
(BOTS_FIRST_MACHINE up), which no real machine takes: a split screen game has
only its own machine, 0. The bots have no view and no controller: nothing is
drawn for them. */
