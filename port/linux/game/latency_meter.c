/*
LATENCY_METER.C

The latency meter of a network game (multiplayer and co-op; system link, ad
hoc and online alike, directly or through a relay): this machine's round
trip to the host, "Ping 45 ms" with four bars, green below 80 ms, yellow
below 150, red above, at the screen's top right while a game is played
(under the shields, above voice chat's talkers; the FPS counter is at the
bottom right, game chat's lines at the left), and the scoreboard's Ping
column (game_engine.c).

What it shows is the distributed netcode's own round trip (port/linux/
NETCODE.md, "The round trip"), timed in milliseconds rather than ticks
(network_distributed.c, distributed_player_ping): nothing is sent for it.

- A client: its players' input names the host's latest tick it had, and the
  host's state of its player names the client's tick the host has it at
  (its own prediction come back; driving, its vehicle's). The time since
  this machine sent that tick is the round trip: the network's both ways,
  and each machine's wait for its next tick to send what it had (up to a
  tick, 33 ms, each; on a LAN 15 to 35 ms in all). A client that has heard
  nothing from the host for two seconds shows "Connection problem",
  pulsing, instead (the Xbox's own "trouble is brewing" comes later).
- The host: its clients' round trips, timed the same way by when it sent
  the tick each client's input names. It shows "Max ping", its slowest
  client's (one silent for a while as long as it has been); the
  scoreboard, each client's, its own players' 0. Another client's is not
  known on a client: its scoreboard has its own players' alone.

Shown with Latency meter On (the Vita's settings panel, Multiplayer;
HALO_LATENCY_METER; network.latency_meter on a desktop), the default, and
never in the menus, a game over, a co-op cutscene (but a connection
problem), or a game the host plays alone.
